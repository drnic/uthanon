# Uthanon

Create SM extensions from real system configurations.

Go into running systems, and using Uthanon you can create reproducible installations, configuration and start up scripts, which include test suites based on the original real systems.

## Why is it called Uthanon?

Random name. I assumed it was unique; and Google confirmed this by attempting to correct me with "Did you mean: Uthayan, Uthando, Thanon or Utah Non"
